How to play:
____________

Each player takes turns entering their move. To choose a position, type in a two digit integer and press enter.
The first digit of the integer is the x-position and the second digit is the y position. The x and y go from left to right and top to bottom.

For example: to play in the middle one would enter `11` and to play in the top right one would enter `20`. This would end up in a game state like this:
```
--2
-1-
---
```
